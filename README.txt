PAGE INVENTORY SPREADSHEET TOOL
-------------------------------
Due to the nature of this tool and the pursuit of refinement, I have decided to NOT make it into a .exe file just yet until everything is finalized. If it's easier, MAC users can also open the script in PyCharm or any IDE and run it thru there. (The EXE will be made soon).

HOW TO RUN:
For Mac Users
0.) FOLLOW THE PREREQUISITES. Place Folder in Desktop
1.) Open Terminal (press Cmd + Space, type Terminal, press Enter)
2.) Copy this and enter: 

cd ~/Desktop/page-inventory-tool

3.) Run the script:

python3 script.py

For WINDOWS USERS:
1.) DO THE PREREQ
2.) run: run_analytics.bat


Prerequisites:
1.) Install Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/. During install, make sure “Add Python to PATH” is checked (important!)
2.) Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows), then type;
	pip install -r requirements.txt (for windows)
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt (for MAC)

2.a) If you don't know how to open terminal or command prompt, just search it in your computer directory
3.) Right click and unzip the file
